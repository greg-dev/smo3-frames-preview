# smo3-frames-preview

[Smоtri.cоm](https://href.li/?http://ujeb.se/TVkzK) is one of the most popular russian video hosting sites with a big community and live broadcasts.
As it doesn't provide any possibility to replay recent streams, to let see what happened durring brodcasts we can use preview stream frames generated every minute and stored on assets hosts for a few months.
This simple script will let you find such preview pictures and view them as a gallery.

## Running
1. Find any broadcast image available on the site (it might be the current picture if the broadcast is live or the last one if the broadcast has ended).
2. Paste the image url into the `url` field.
3. Adjust `start` and `end` values to limit the number of requests (currently up to 10 requests needed to find one preview frame).
4. Click the `submit` button and watch broadcast frames appearing one by one.
